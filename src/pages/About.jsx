            <p>Hi there, I'm Joshua! An aspiring software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to living life to the fullest. Currently {age}-years old, I bring several years of experience working on dynamic Rails projects, but am also constantly seeking opportunities to learn and embrace new technology stacks.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>In my journey, I've developed a deep appreciation for the art of coding and the intricacies of software development. I love discussing and solving problems, always questioning everything to ensure a thorough understanding. My enthusiasm extends to designing robust and scalable architectures that will still be usable in the future.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Beyond the world of coding, I love food and travelling. Discovering new cuisines and experiencing different cultures makes me happiest.
